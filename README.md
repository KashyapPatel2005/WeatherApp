## WeatherApp - A Real-Time Weather Application

WeatherApp is a real-time weather forecasting application built using ReactJS that allows users to search for current weather conditions in any city across the globe. The app fetches live weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays key weather metrics, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions. The application is designed to be responsive and user-friendly, making it easy for users to check the weather updates quickly.

This project showcases the integration of a third-party API within a ReactJS application while maintaining clean and structured state management. Additionally, it demonstrates how to handle API requests efficiently and securely store API keys using environment variables.
